# Comparte models for fine-tuning with original image dataset

Fine-tuning approach: train only the last half of blocks.

last half = number of blocks / 2, if the number is uneven, add 1.

## Models compared

- Xception (14 blocks. 7 first pre-trained)
- 

## Parameters

- batch size = 100
- number of epoch = 200
- steps per epoch = 4
